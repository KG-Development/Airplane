# Airplane

Just a project, created by two friends. We want to develop a realistic (as far as we can) model of a airplane. including modeling the turbines, fuel, lights, wind resistance, ...
as the project just started, there are currently only debug informations and simple input/output. Right now we are just setting this whole thing up.

currently:

Input is working with an input flow (the program doesn't wait till the user gives an input)
Wind resistance is working as an ADT
Acceleration is working
Creating an Airplane config works
Printing out all the debug information works
The turbines are working (mostly) correctly
it prints a ASCII - Cockpit
